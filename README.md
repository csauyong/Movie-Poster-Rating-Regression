# Movie-Poster-Rating-Regression
Repository for storing files related to the project on predicting movies' IMDB scores with their poster.

As a frequent moviegoer, I started this hobby project to find the relation between designs of movie posters and their IMDB scores. While the images are downloaded from Kaggle, I built my own data set by transforming the images into arrays and extracting the IMDB score from the file name as labels. 

This methodology of this project is deep learning with CNN rather than machine learning as I chose to leave feature extraction for the network. I couldn't find much constructive indicators as feature which may boost accuracy.
